LuckyIrisInu

LUCKYIRISHINU is a community DEFI token built on FAITH, LOVE, HOPE, and LUCK. These will be the values embraced by the LUCKY IRISH INU community to support one another. We will help each other build rainbow bridges to the moon. If one of us falls, he/she must kill the Leprechaun at the end of that rainbow, steal its gold and redistribute it to all of us. LUCKYIRISHINU is a unique token with CAKE Reflection every 6 hours and a Mini Jackpot that randomly awards a lucky LUCKYIRISHINU hodler whenever it reaches 100 CAKE.

May the Irish Luck be with all of you!

## FUN FACTS ABOUT FOUR-LEAF CLOVER

    There are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every "lucky" four-leaf clover.
    There are no clover plants that naturally produce four leaves, which is why four-leaf clovers are so rare.
    The leaves of four-leaf clovers are said to stand for Faith, Hope, Love, and Luck.
    It's often said that Ireland is home to more four-leaf clovers than any other place, giving meaning to the phrase "the luck of the Irish."
    If you're lucky enough to find a four-leaf clover, look for more! If a clover plant produces a four-leaf clover, it's more likely to produce another four-leaf lucky charm than plants that only produce three-leaf clovers.
    The fourth leaf can be smaller or a different shade of green than the other three leaves
    Shamrocks and four-leaf clovers are not the same thing; the word 'shamrock' refers only to a clover with three leaves.
